# Smart Industrial Waste Monitoring System
A hardware-software prototype designed to efficiently monitor and manage municipal solid waste with IoT sensors and a user-friendly web app.

# Overview
This system combines sensors and web technology to send automatic alerts when waste bins are full, helping authorities act promptly and improve urban cleanliness.

# Features
1. Ultrasonic Sensor Integration: Detects when bins reach capacity.

2. ESP8266 WiFi Transmission: Sends sensor data in real time to the central server.

3. Interactive Dashboard: Clean frontend for monitoring bin statuses and alerting staff.

4. Automatic Alerts: Notifies municipal staff when bins need emptying.

# Tech Stack
Python (Flask backend)

JavaScript, HTML, CSS (frontend)

ESP8266 microcontroller, Ultrasonic sensors

# Getting Started
1. Connect the ultrasonic sensor to ESP8266 as per hardware docs.

2. Flash firmware and connect the ESP8266 to your WiFi.

3. Clone this repo, install backend dependencies, and run the server.

4. Open the frontend in your browser and monitor real-time updates.
